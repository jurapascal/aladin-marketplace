# Offer Letter

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Draft a professional offer letter for a new employee or contractor
- Include position details, compensation, benefits, and start date
- Create a reusable offer letter template for future hires
- Formalize a verbal offer into a written document

**DO NOT** use this skill for full employment contracts, contractor agreements, or legal compliance documents. This is for the offer letter — the document that communicates the offer. Consult legal counsel for binding employment contracts.

---

## Core Principle

AN OFFER LETTER IS A FIRST IMPRESSION AS AN EMPLOYER — IT SHOULD BE CLEAR, PROFESSIONAL, AND EXCITING ENOUGH THAT THE CANDIDATE FEELS GREAT ABOUT SAYING YES.

---

## Phase 1: Offer Details

Gather the specific terms of the offer.

### Required Inputs

| Input | What to Ask | Default |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Candidate name** | "Who is the offer for?" | No default |
| **Position title** | "What is the job title?" | No default |
| **Employment type** | "Full-time, part-time, or contractor?" | No default |
| **Start date** | "When should they start?" | No default |
| **Compensation** | "What is the salary or rate?" | No default |
| **Pay frequency** | "How often will they be paid? (weekly, biweekly, monthly)" | Biweekly |
| **Benefits** | "What benefits are included? (health, PTO, remote stipend, etc.)" | Varies |
| **Manager** | "Who will they report to?" | Business owner |
| **Work location** | "Remote, hybrid, or on-site?" | Remote |
| **Response deadline** | "When do they need to respond by?" | 5 business days |

### Pre-Offer Checklist

```
- [ ] Compensation confirmed and within budget
- [ ] Start date is feasible (onboarding prep time included)
- [ ] Benefits and perks clearly defined

**GATE: Confirm all offer details before drafting the letter.**

## Phase 3: Personalize

- Something specific from the interview ("Your experience with [X] really stood out")
- A project or goal they will work on ("Your first project will be [X], which I think you will find exciting")
- Why they were chosen ("You were our top candidate because [specific reason]")

### Compensation Presentation

If the offer includes multiple components, present as a total compensation summary:

```
## Your Total Compensation

| Base salary | $[X] |
| Target bonus | $[X] |
| Benefits value | ~$[X] |
| Perks (stipends, development budget) | $[X] |
| **Total** | **$[X]** |
```

### Attachments to Include

- Employee handbook or culture document (if available)
- Benefits summary sheet
- NDA or confidentiality agreement (for signing)
- Employment agreement (if separate from offer letter)
- W-4 or W-9 form

---

## Phase 4: Deliver

Send the offer professionally and follow up.

### Delivery Process

1. Call the candidate first to deliver the offer verbally (builds excitement)
2. Send the written offer letter within 2 hours of the call
3. Give them the stated deadline (typically 3-5 business days)
4. Check in after 2 days if no response ("Any questions I can answer?")

### Negotiation Prep

If the candidate negotiates:
- Know your maximum before the conversation
- Be open to creative alternatives (remote stipend, extra PTO, flexible hours) if base salary is firm
- Respond within 24 hours to counter-offers
- Get final agreement in writing

### After Acceptance

```
## Post-Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Send confirmation email with next steps
- [ ] Begin onboarding preparation (see onboarding-checklist skill)
- [ ] Notify the team about the new hire and start date
- [ ] Prepare tool access and accounts
- [ ] Schedule Day 1 welcome meeting
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Verbal offer only** — always put offers in writing. Verbal offers lead to misunderstandings about terms.
- **Vague compensation** — "Competitive salary" is not an offer. State the exact number.
- **No response deadline** — without a deadline, offers linger and create uncertainty for both sides.
- **Cold delivery** — emailing an offer without a phone call first misses the chance to build excitement and answer questions.
- **Overpromising benefits** — do not list benefits you cannot deliver. Under-promise and over-deliver.

---

## Recovery

- **Candidate declines the offer:** Ask what would change their mind. Sometimes a small adjustment (start date, remote flexibility, title) makes the difference. If they decline, respond graciously — they may refer someone.
- **Candidate negotiates higher than budget:** Know your walk-away number before the conversation. Offer non-monetary alternatives if salary is at max.
- **Candidate ghosts after receiving the offer:** Follow up at Day 3 and Day 5. If no response by the deadline, send a final message and move to your backup candidate.
- **User has never written an offer letter:** Use the template above with minimal customization. A simple, clear offer letter is better than a delayed one.
- **Legal concerns about the language:** Add a disclaimer: "This letter is not a contract of employment." Recommend the user have a lawyer review the template before first use.
